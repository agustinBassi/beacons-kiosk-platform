## Platform Description

The goal of this project is to create an open source Bluetooth LE Platform to be used as a part of an IoT system, based on Bluetooth LE technology.

The platform consists in several sub-application described below:

* **Beacons Observer**: An HTTP REST API with beacon packages scanning features, which can reads different beacon types. By this module you can configure filters, scan time, turn on/off the beacon scanner, and get different beacon-related information like the nearest beacons, the list of beacon read, and many others.  
* **HTTP Client**: An HTTP Client that can executes different HTTP Request to Beacon Scanner API. There, the user can configure Beacon filters, scan time, turn on/off the scanner and other ones.  
* **Beacons Broadcasters**: A bunch of utilities for different platforms to generate beacon packages from devices like ESP32, Linux Systems or event any compatible smartphone.
* **Content Management System**: A CMS to associate each beacon to different content or action.

All of this parts are well described in the [Project Wiki](https://github.com/agustinBassi/ble-connection/wiki). Please, refer to it in order to get all required information.

In the figure below there is a description of the platform modules and how they interact each others.

## 
## Install dependencies


The application runs over Raspberry Pi 3+ (or Linux system based in Debian). To install Raspberry Pi OS refer to [official documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/).

The platform needs the next dependencies.

* Python 3.x (installation steps in [official documentation](https://python.org)).
* Docker (installation steps in [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)).
* Docker-Compose (installation steps in [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)).

Once dependencies above are installed, execute the next command to install Bluetooth packages into the system.

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libbluetooth-dev libcap2-bin bluetooth bluez-utils blueman
```

Reached this point you can proceed running the project.

## 
## Run the application

Once dependencies are installed in the Raspberry Pi do the next steps.

1. Download the platform code (this repository) with the next command.

```
git clone https://github.com/agustinBassi/ble-connection.git
cd ble-connection/
```

2. Compile the Beacons-Observer docker image with the command below.

```
docker-compose build beacons-observer
```

3. Start the Beacons-Observer and the HTTP Client with the next command.

```
docker-compose up
```

4. Run the HTTP Client opening [http://raspberri_pi_ip:5001/](http://raspberri_pi_ip:5001/) in the web browser.
